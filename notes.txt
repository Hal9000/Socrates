Stuff to know:
--------------
reopened classes
class skeleton
$LOAD_PATH trick
$SAFE in a thread
Integer vs to_i
to_s vs to_str
puts/print/p (to_s, inspect)
inspect and eval
STDOUT.flush
trailing naked hash
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
# encoding: UTF-8
class << self
bang doesn't necessarily mean mutator
Bundler (spec, install, setup, require)
new hash notation
a class is just a constant (x = A::B::C)
rescue modifier
scan is similar to split
know your 'self'
instance_eval, etc.
values_at is your friend
*args tricks, e.g. z = [*x, *y]
shift/unshift (left or first)
push/pop (right or last)
returning data from threads 
the "empty case"
strings and symbols
Symbol#to_proc
the Sequel debugging trick
(Bart Simpson and organ transplants)

# Avoiding the empty hash:
def meth(*args, hash)
  unless hash.is_a? Hash
    args << hash
    hash = {}
  end
  p *args
  p hash
end




Scattered classes
 - isolate function by file
Class skeleton
allocate

TopicStore - when you define the class, it loads the data

“Computer science is the discipline that believes all problems can be solved with one more level of indirection” –. Dennis DeBruler 

There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things. -Phil Karlton

Niels Bohr: Your theory is crazy...
"Though this be madness..."
PassiveRecord
  - models are object models, not db models
  - isolate db *and* ORM
  - don't clutter model code
  - don't clutter models at runtime
  - inheritance: make and create
  

How to add a question type

------
hash = {this: "that"}  
def meth(a, b, *c, d)  # d can be a (naked) hash
# but old style is:
def meth(a, b, c, d)   # where c must be bracketed

Does sequel console work for JRuby?


/Users/Hal/top5/socrates/vendor/bundle/ruby/1.9.1/gems/sequel-3.36.1/lib/sequel/sql.rb
defines a to_s(ds) method - bleah?

{:foo => Integer}.to_yaml gives an error

"jdbc:sqlite:socrates.db" -- No // in Java

JRuby doesn't know ord or modern str[0]
JRuby doesn't know $SAFE

Swing:
------
camelCase = snake_case
.get_foo = .foo
.set_foo = .foo =
.isFoo   = .is_foo = .is_foo?


Possible options for questions:
  :nocase  Case insensitive
  :damerau Damerau-Levenshtein distance
  :nopunc  Ignore any punctuation
  :nospace Ignore all spaces
  (By default - strip only leading/trailing spaces)
  :random  Choices are randomized

Future ideas:
  Question options
  Point values for questions
  Author field for questions
  Multi-user support
  Sophisticated question presentation algorithm


Semantic versioning boils down to:

    PATCH 0.0.x level changes for implementation level detail changes, such as small bug fixes
    MINOR 0.x.0 level changes for any backwards compatible API changes, such as new functionality/features
    MAJOR x.0.0 level changes for backwards incompatible API changes, such as changes that will break existing users code if they update
